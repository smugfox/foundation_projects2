Finished Team Treehouse's second project using Foundation 4.  This one looks like the second
project from the bootstrap project.  

Final thoughts on Foundation and Bootstrap:
I seem to enjoy foundation a little more than I did bootstrap.  Maybe it's because I was doing two 
projects in bootstrap, and then foundation, but it just felt a lot easier to understand to me.

Going to go and try their Foundation 5 course next.
